# Ultimate Hugo Theme

Ultimate is a Hugo theme developed by [Session Technologies](https://session.it) which focuses on the following aspects:
- Editors peace of mind: deliver a simple workflow for editors to change contents, building an intuitive folder and file structure
- Layout flexibility: allow editors to compose their pages using pre-defined section layouts in different orders, across all website pages
- Feature-rich: Multi-language, simple integration with Google Analytics, Jivo chat, Privy and more
- Documentation and tutorials on how to go live with a website built with the Ultimate theme
- Production-ready: Responsive, uber-fast w3c validated, SEO-optimised (`<meta>` configuration)
- Truly open source: only uses open source libraries with permissive licenses, such as MIT and Apache Software License (ASL), which are listed below. All code in this repository is released under ASL 2.0
- Ongoing maintenance, updating to latest libraries, fixing bugs, extending section layouts and other theme features
